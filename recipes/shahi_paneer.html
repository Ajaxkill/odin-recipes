    <p>Shahi Paneer is a popular and rich dish in Mughlai cuisine, known for its creamy texture and delicious taste. It is made with paneer (a type of fresh cheese) and a creamy gravy made from nuts, onions, yogurt, and spices. The dish is fragrant with flavors of onion, ginger, garlic, red chili powder, saffron, and cardamom, and is often served with naan or roti.
