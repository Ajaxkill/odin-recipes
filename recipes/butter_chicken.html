    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Butter chicken, also known as murgh makhani, is a rich and creamy Indian curry made with tender chicken pieces cooked in a spiced tomato and butter sauce. It is believed to have originated in Delhi in the 1950s, and has since gained popularity around the world. The dish is made by marinating chicken in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and spices, then cooking it in a tandoor or on a grill. The sauce is made by simmering a mixture of tomatoes, garlic, ginger, and spices until smooth and velvety, and is then enriched with butter and cream. The result is a delicious and aromatic dish that is popular in Indian restaurants and homes alike.</p>
